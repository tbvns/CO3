# Client of our own

CO3 is a free reader app for **Archive of Our Own** (AO3). We built it because other AO3 apps charge money for features that should be free. </br>
The goal is to give you a better reading experience on your phone with features like native AMOLED support, local reading history, and custom categories to organize your stories.

## Features:
- **Custom library** - Save your favorite works in one place
- **Category management** - Organize your stories however you want (without paying for it)
- **History with filters** - Find works you've read by date
- **Completely free** - No subscriptions, no ads, ever

## Planned features
- Update notifications when new chapters come out
- Bookmarks
- View and read comments
- User profile pages
- Statistics screen
- Download works to read offline

> [!CAUTION]
> This app is in development. A LOT of buttons currently do nothing.
> 
> If you notice any issues, please report them. I will fix them as soon as possible.
